        <h2>What can I do?</h2>
            <h3>There are many different steps you can take to get us closer to our goals, one is of course to make your voice heard, and to spread our campaign through your community as well as social media but we think that as long as you are making an effort to spread awareness or to get the word out about this, you are making a difference in shaping the future.</h3>
        <h2>Why is the earth unsustainable as it is?</h2>
            <h3>As a species we have gone from merely a billion at the start of the 1800th century to around 7,9 billion today and it is estimated that we will reach 10 billion in and around 2060. With knowing that we can come to the conclusion that the resources that we have on earth are limited, and with the amount of people on the planet growing each day and that means that those resources will get depleted even quicker, and that we can't go on like we are doing. We also only have so much space on the planet and only so much of that space is habitable for us.</h3>
        <h2>How long will it be until we can colonize another planet?</h2>
            <h3>How long it will be until we can colonize another planet is a very hard question and answering it relies on us knowing when people will see the error of their ways and put more into space programs. But not only that, it would also require us to predict the discoveries we would find and the things that we would do.</h3>
            <h3>We can't say how long it will take, but we can say that the amount of challenges ahead of us won't change, but the time we have to overcome them will.</h3>
