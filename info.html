        <h2>Description</h2>
            <h3>The earth is unsustainable with the amount of people we have on the planet and the way we choose to live and the number of people will only increase in these coming years and as mass homicide is seen as taboo, the only remaining option seems to be to colonize space. Now that is not an easy task but if we focus our resources and budgets towards space programs and other things that would put us closer to that goal today, it would go a long way to secure the survival of our species and our history. The increased resources and budget to space programs would also lead to a lot more jobs in the tech industry and the discoveries we would encounter on the way to our goal can make life on earth as we know it change for the better as well. There are really no cons to allocating the budgets and our resources to the space programs, if we are smart enough to move the budget from less important matters like the military, we would also be able to resources from space making it less urgent to colonize space giving us more time here on earth.</h3>
        <h2>About us</h2>
            <h3>We are a non-profit campaign originating from Sweden, that wants to inform the general public about the state of our planet, our species as well as the underlying problem that we have and are facing. And to inform you on what we think the solution is and how we can achieve it and what the general public can do to help. Our final goal is to be able to colonize space but the biggest step we can take in the right direction right now is either to increase the funding of space programs or to better our living conditions here on earth.</h3>
